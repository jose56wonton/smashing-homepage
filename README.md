# Smashing Homepage
This is my 5th HTML/CSS project. It is a grayscale heat map of Smashing's [homepage](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/).
To see the exact version go to this [web archive](http://web.archive.org/), and look for the date that is closest to July 18th, 2017.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge of visual heirarchy and to test out Google fonts.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown)!
